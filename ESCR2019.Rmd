#Points to drive home on teen mental health

&nbsp;

.Large[
Eivind Hansen, director of Haukeland University Hospital<br /> <br /> Do provide information to youth that:
- clearly characterises symptoms of mental health disorders, thus increasing the teen's awareness of unhealthy behavior
- encourges youth to be open and seek help early
- breaks the stigma of anxiety, cumpulsive behavior and depression
- teaches youth to support those in need of help

We can *always* be better!]
